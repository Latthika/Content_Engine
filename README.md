# Content_Engine
This project focuses on creating a sophisticated Content Engine Bot designed to analyze and compare multiple PDF documents, specifically Form 10-K filings from Alphabet Inc., Tesla, Inc., and Uber Technologies, Inc. The system leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to retrieve, assess, and generate insights from the documents.
